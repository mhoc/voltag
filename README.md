voltag
======

An Android game where two or more people can play tag with one-another using NFC. Uses Parse as a backend. 

To Fix:

* If a player who is it leaves a game, assign "it" to another random player in the game.
* When a new player joins a game, alert all the other players in the game.
* When a player leaves a game, alert all other players in the game.
* Give players the option to drop registration in the app.
